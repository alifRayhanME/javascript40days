    <title>Javascript Loading Method</title>
    <!-- <script src="app.js"></script> -->
    <!--  * When we import a JavaScript file in the HTML head tag, the browser loads and executes the JavaScript before the HTML body is fully loaded.
    * Therefore, the script cannot interact with body elements, and the browser console shows an error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null -->

    <!-- <script async src="app.js"></script> -->
    <!-- * The script is downloaded in parallel, improving page load speed, but executes before HTML is fully loaded.
    * Async scripts may not execute in the order they appear, causing potential issues with multiple scripts. -->


    <script defer src="app.js"></script>
    <!-- * The script is downloaded in parallel with HTML parsing, but executed only after the HTML is fully parsed.
    * Defer ensures scripts run in order and allows interaction with DOM elements. -->

  <body>
    <h1>welcome to javascript learning</h1>
    <div id="box1"></div>
    <!-- <script>
      document.getElementById("box1").innerText = "i am from javascript in html script tag";
    </script> -->
    <!-- * This works, but it's good practice to separate HTML and JavaScript.
    * HTML handles structure, JavaScript handles dynamic behavior.
    * Keeping JavaScript in its own file makes the code reusable and easier to manage. -->

    <!-- <script src="app.js"></script> -->
    <!-- *This works, but the script is loaded and executed only after the entire HTML file has been loaded. -->
  </body>
